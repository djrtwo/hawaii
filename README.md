An informal planning doc for /r/ethfinance in hawaii in 2022

## Who is it?

This is an open event. Ideally it would include people who are interested in Ethereum and their families. There is no formal registration process, but I anticipate developing a list of people who plan to attend. If interest increases I'll set up an organizational github page.

## What is it?

HodlerCon 2022

## Where is it?

We'll choose a city on the Hawaiian islands

## When is it?

June or July 2022, when US schools are on summer break. It's not the ideal week for everyone, but will probably involve the most people. The exact week will be identified as we move forward.

## What are the conditions?

If Ether is trading above $1420 on Monday, January 10, 2022, the event will be greenlighted. This essentially means that anyone who said they were going is going to sell their Hawaii stash (and crash the market) around January 10 and begin buying plane tickets, booking hotels, etc.

## What will the event be like?

Informal is the key here. We'll pick a week and an area of a city and generally congregate. The intention is for families and friends to have an opportunity to celebrate the ride together. Meals and gatherings will be penciled in before we go, but the true point is to relax and spend time with your family and people you kind of know from the Internet.
