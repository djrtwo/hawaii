An informal planning doc for /r/ethfinance in hawaii in 2022

![Hodlercon 2022](/ethfinance.jpg)

## Who is it?

This is an open event. Ideally it would include people who are interested in Ethereum and their families. There is no formal registration process, but I anticipate developing a list of people who plan to attend. If interest increases I'll set up an organizational github page.

## What is it?

HodlerCon 2022

## Where is it?

We're suggestng reservations at the [Kaua'i Beach Club (Marriott)](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lihka-marriotts-kauai-beach-club/), with a nightly rendezvous at Duke's inside the resort.

## When is it?

Tuesday, June 21, 2022 to Thursday, June 30, 2022.

## What are the conditions?

If Ether is trading above $1420 on Monday, January 10, 2022, the event will be greenlighted. This essentially means that anyone who said they were going is going to sell their Hawaii stash around January 10 and begin buying plane tickets, booking hotels, etc. It's important to note that the price of Ether may exceed $1420 before that date, but it must be trading ABOVE $1420 on January 10, 2022 to greenlight the trip. 

## What will the event be like?

This is first and foremost a chance for people to visit Hawaii with their family to celebrate the success of Ethereum, secondary to that goal it's a chance for Ethfinancier's to get together and shoot the shit. Meals and gatherings will be penciled in before we go, but the true point is to relax and spend time with your family and people you kind of know from the Internet. Any participant may make arrangements and announce them and/or invite others to join in, participants may create novelty ERC 721 tokens, and do any sort of additional organzizing that they choose, but the core concept of the trip is purposefully disorganized.
